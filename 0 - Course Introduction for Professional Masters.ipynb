    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read Lab 0 if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",

    "### Pre-requisites / Expectations\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Python** is assumed to be known before you enroll this course.  I shall give you a crash course, but for those without any prior experience in Python, it will be extremely difficult.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* I have prepare some tutorials you must self-study with the beginning \"0\". Please look through them as it will be helpful to understand the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always read before you come to the class.  It will be very helpful to your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of *ouptput* students this course wants to produce\n",
    "\n",
    "I have actually high expectations of myself to develop strong mathematical and programming skills in students.  Here are what I expect the students who finish my course will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **code python fluently**, with good object-oriented (OO) and software engineering (SE) principles.  In a sense, students should be able to write class in a \"clean\", \"efficient\", and \"pythonic\" way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-study** advanced python stuffs in the future by increasing literacy in reading APIs, documentations, etc.  Thus, I encourage students to read APIs frequently, instead of just copying answers from StackOverflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **read mathematics** on any given research papers without too much difficulty.  Thus I shall cover machine learning algorithms from the perspectives of mathematics, as a mean for you to get acquainted with mathematics.  Also, we shall ask you to read LOTs of papers in your project, to get you acquainted with maths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **translate those mathematical knowledge to python programming**.  Thus, our class will focus on coding from scratch, rather than using library such as sklearn or pytorch but sklearn and pyTorch will be taught as well but will not be the focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to understand what are some useful machine learning algorithms, how to implement them, and most importantly, *when* or *when NOT* to use them.  Thus I shall regularly compare and contrast different algorithms, i.e., weakness and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-explore, self-learn beyond the course materials, and link all the knowledge** you have, and combined with your own unique background (e.g., economics, medicine, finance, retail) to solve a particular data problem.  More importantly, able to *judge whether a problem is worth solving*.   Thus I shall hope that project is a good starting point.\n",

    "### Project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to pick a project topic. **To pick a project topic, you are required to read at least 5 papers of the recent 3-5 years.**  I have compiled **0 - Reading Roadmap** which is a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most students do one of three kinds of projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application project.** This is by far the most common: Pick an application that interests you, and explore how best to apply learning algorithms to solve it.  Of course, you will then need to read 10 or 20 papers, mostly application oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic project**. Pick a problem or family of problems, and develop a new learning algorithm, or a novel variant of an existing algorithm, to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Theoretical project.** Prove some interesting/non-trivial properties of a new or an existing learning algorithm. (This is often quite difficult, and so very few, if any, projects will be purely theoretical.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A very good project (grade A) will be a publishable or nearly-publishable piece of work**. Each year, some number of students continue working on their projects, submitting their work to a conferences or journals. Thus, for related work, you might also look at some recent machine learning research papers. Two of the main machine learning conferences are ICML and NIPS. You can find papers from the recent ICML https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule and NeurIPS conference https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified a topic of interest, it can be useful to look up existing research on relevant topics by searching related keywords on an academic search engine such as: http://scholar.google.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of designing your project is to identify one or several **datasets** suitable for your topic of interest. If that data needs considerable pre-processing  to suit your task, or that you intend to collect the needed data yourself, keep in mind that this is only one part of the expected project work, but can often take considerable time. We still expect a solid methodology and discussion of results, so pace your project accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on a few specific types of projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep learning projects**: Since our course discusses many other concepts besides deep learning, we ask that if you decide to work on a deep learning project, please make sure that you use other material you learned in the class as well. For example, you might set up logistic regression and SVM baselines, or do some data analysis using the unsupervised methods covered in class. We may grade these projects using different criteria to make sure that grading is fair for students who have not had exposure to DL before. Finally, training deep learning models can be very time consuming, so make sure you have the necessary computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessed datasets**: While we don't want you to have to spend much time collecting raw data, the process of inspecting and visualizing the data, trying out different types of preprocessing, and doing error analysis is often an important part of machine learning. Hence if you choose to use preprepared datasets (e.g. from Kaggle, the UCI machine learning repository, etc.) we encourage you to do some data exploration and analysis to get familiar with the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replicating results**: Replicating the results in a paper can be a good way to learn. However, we ask that instead of just replicating a paper, also try using the technique on another application, or do some analysis of how each component of the model contributes to final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Parts: Proposal, Progress Report, and Final Report Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains the detailed instructions for the different parts of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group number**: 1 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission**: We’ll be using Google classroom for submission of all three parts of the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "The poster and final report will combine to be the majority of the grade. Projects will be evaluated based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The technical quality of the work.** (I.e., Does the technical material make sense? Are the things tried reasonable? Are the proposed algorithms or applications clever and interesting? Do the authors convey novel insight about the problem and/or algorithms?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significance**. (Did the authors choose an interesting or a “real\" problem to work on, or only a small “toy\" problem? Is this work likely to be useful and/or have impact?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The novelty of the work.** (Is this project applying a common technique to a well-studied problem, or is the problem or method relatively unexplored?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to highlight these components, it is important you present a solid discussion regarding the learnings from the development of your method, and summarizing how your work compares to existing approaches.  Last but not least, we tend to judge anything that is publishable or nearly to be a A project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Proposal report**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project proposal, you'll pick a project idea to work on early and receive feedback from the mentor.  Make sure you read at least 10 papers for mini project and 20 papers for mega project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the proposal, below your project title, include the project category. The category can be one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Athletics & Sensing Devices\n",
    "- Audio & Music\n",
    "- Computer Vision\n",
    "- Finance & Commerce\n",
    "- General Machine Learning\n",
    "- Life Sciences\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing\n",
    "- Neuroscience\n",
    "- Physical Sciences\n",
    "- Theory & Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Format* - Paper writing in **IEEE format**.  You MUST use latex format (.tex) and submit both PDF and latex.  Format can be downloaded here (https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-journal-article/authoring-tools-and-templates/tools-for-ieee-authors/ieee-article-templates/ - choose journal)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Duration* - This will be a one week work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Length* - Typically, the proposal will include the Introduction and Related Work, and the Method section, so roughly 2 pages will suffice, excluding references.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Github* - Initialize a git repository containing the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project proposal should include the following information:\n",
    "- Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?\n",
    "- Related work: What are the gap of the current work?\n",
    "- Method: What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon?\n",
    "- Intended experiments: What experiments are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your machine learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting pointers to one relevant dataset and one example of prior research on the topic are a valuable (optional) addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading* - The project proposal is mainly intended to make sure you decide on a project topic early. As long as your proposal follows the instructions above and the project seems to have been thought out with a reasonable plan, you should do well on the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Progress Report**\n",
    "\n",
    "The progress report will help you make sure you're on track, and should describe what you've accomplished so far, and very briefly say what else you plan to do. You should write it as if it's an “early draft\" of what will turn into your final project. You can write it as if you're writing the first few pages of your final project report, so that you can re-use most of the progress report text in your final report. Please write the milestone (and final report) keeping in mind that the intended audience are the instructors. Thus, for example, **you should not spend two pages explaining what logistic regression is**. Your milestone should include the full names of all your team members and state the full title of your project. Note: We will expect your final writeup to be on the same topic as your progress report.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Duration* - This will be around a two weeks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Length* - Typically, the proposal will include the Introduction and Related Work, and the Method section but with added details, so roughly 3 pages will suffice, excluding references.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Github* - Commit things to the repository.  Similarly, grading shall be judged based on the weight of committments by each member.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the proposal, it should include (revised version):\n",
    "- Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?\n",
    "- Related work: What are the gap of the current work?\n",
    "- Method: What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon?\n",
    "- Preliminary experiments: Describe the experiments that you've run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you've done. You should have tried at least one baseline.\n",
    "- Next steps: Given your preliminary results, what are the next steps that you're considering?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading* - The progress report is mainly intended to make sure you are making a reasonable progress and get feedback from mentor early. As long as your progress report follows the instructions above and you seem to have tested any assumptions which might prevent your team from completing the project, you should do well on the progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Final Report and Presentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that most students work very hard on the final projects, and so we are extremely careful to give each writeup ample attention, and read and try very hard to understand everything you describe in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Duration* - This will be around a two weeks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Length* - Final report writeups can be at most 5 pages long (including appendices and figures). We will allow for extra pages containing only references.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Github* - Commit all the code and your additions to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the proposal, it should include (revised version):\n",
    "- Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?\n",
    "- Related work: What are the gap of the current work?\n",
    "- Method: What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon?\n",
    "- Experiments: Describe the experiments that you've run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you've done. You should have tried at least one baseline.   This should be more rigorous than your progress report.\n",
    "- Discussion: Interpret your results.  Why do you think the results are like that?  What would you do differently?  Do you get what you want?  How far/close to your related are you?\n",
    "- Future work: What would be a promising future work you would do, following this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading* - The final report will be judged based off of the clarity of the report, the relevance of the project to topics taught in this course, the novelty of the problem, and the technical quality and significance of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the deliverables as part of the project?\n",
    "    - Proposal \n",
    "        - Github repo link containing report in LaTeX and PDF format, and README file.\n",
    "    - Progress report\n",
    "        - Github repo link containining report in LaTeX and PDF format, jupyter notebooks/python code, dataset link, and the slides\n",
    "    - Final report\n",
    "        - Github repo link containining report in LaTeX and PDF format, jupyter notebooks/python code, dataset link, and the slides\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. Should project use only methods taught in classroom?\n",
    "No, we encourage you to read more recent papers and recent methods.  But make sure you always include some **baseline methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can I use libraries like sklearn or pyTorch or from scratch?\n",
    "Any libraries are fine but Python is a must.  For deep learning, we highly recommend you using pyTorch because I ONLY know pyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can I not use Github?\n",
    "No.  There is optional tool like bitbucket but we found that it is just too much hurdles to look at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is there any particular project we don't recommend?\n",
    "Yes, example projects such as those tutorials in Kaggle or medium.com will NOT be ok.  We judge for novelty, significance, and technicality, so usually those projects will not be sufficient.  Also, if you want to work on certain project, make sure you have enough domain knowledge.  For example, if you want to work on finance, make sure you know finance really well."
