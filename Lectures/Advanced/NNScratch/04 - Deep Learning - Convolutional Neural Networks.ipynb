    "So far we have focused on **Dense** layers (or also known as fully-connected layer) which are nice in understanding relationships.  Adding **activation function** like Sigmoid or Tanh allows us to understand the non-linear relationship between features and output, with Tanh having a steeper gradient, allowing the network to learn faster.  Adding **SoftMaxCrossEntropy** also enhance the gradient produced but remember that it only works with classification problems.  Adding **Dropout** helps in overfitting; **glorot initialization** to make sure the weight is normally distributed, **learning decay** to make sure we eventually reach the minimum instead of hopping all over the places, and last, the **momentum** to make sure we do not stuck in local minimum.  Such architecture is usally quite okay for **normal classification** problem.   \n",

If we have lots of images, the input shall be <code>(batch size, input channels, image height, image width)</code>.  For our case, if it is a grayscale image, the shape is <code>(1, 14, 14)</code>.  If it is a RGB image, it shall be <code>(3, 14, 14)</code>.  If it is a CMYK, it shall be <code>(4, 14, 14)</code>.  If I define batch size as 500 (out of many more images I have), my input is <code>(500, 4, 14, 14)</code>.  (Commonly, batch size is around few hundreds).\n",

    "1. **How the filters look like?**.  It turns out that each filter actually detect the presence of certain visual pattern.  For example, this filter below detects whether there is an edge at that location of the image.  There are also other similar filters detecting corners, lines, etc.  Check out https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/  and try changing the values\n",

    "Real filters can look like this.  They may look somewhat random at first glance, but we can see that clear structure being learned in most kernels. For example, filters 3 and 4 seem to be learning diagonal edges in opposite directions, and other capture round edges or enclosed spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/kernels.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **it is important to note that we DON'T need to decide the filters** to use.  We can simply feed a random generated filter, and it is the job of CNN to learn these filters.   These learned filters will learn what features are most efficient for the classification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the shape of filters?**.  For each image, we can apply multiple filters, depending on how many output channels we want.  Let's say the input channel is 3, and we want the output channel to 64, then we apply a filter of size <code>(3, 64, filter width, filter height)</code>, just like in Dense layer, where we input <code>(input_neurons, output_neurons)</code>.  What on earth is *output channel*, they are simply the number of patterns detected by your filters.  How do we know how many output channel to use? The answer is we don't know...we just try and see what works.  **The rule of thumb** is to first try a few filters, and gradually increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall talk more about the size of output-width and output-height after convolution.  However, it is important to note that it is NOT necessary that output-width = image-width, and same for height.  That will be determined by how we convolve, which we shall discuss now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the width and height of filters?**  If we use a filter width = filter height = 3, then our filter shape will be <code>(input channel, output channel, 3, 3)</code>.  The question is how to decide the filter height and width.  The idea is that if we use a 3 x 3 filter, each pixel got 8 neighboring information.  On the other hand, if we we use big filter like 9 x 9, then we got 80 neighboring information.  To choose this depends on your image classification task, if you think separating cat and dog images requires fine details like the nose, use a smaller filter.  But if you think it requires high-level details like the shape of the body, then maybe bigger filter size.  **How to choose is NOT science, but is an art, so simply try out.  Another way is to read papers and copy them.  Third is following the typical filter size which is 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why filter is typically odd-square size?** The sole reason of being an odd-square size filter because it is easy to do paddings due to its symmetry.  For example, when a 3x3 filter is used, there would be a padding of 1 in all sides (if you want the output to be of the same size as input). In case of 2x2 filters, there are four possible padding scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left = 1, Right = 0, Top = 0, Bottom = 1\n",
    "- Left = 0, Right = 1, Top = 0, Bottom = 1\n",
    "- Left = 1, Right = 0, Top = 1, Bottom = 0\n",
    "- Left = 0, Right = 1, Top = 1, Bottom = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is unnecessary computation without any benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, why the filter is square is not of importance.  It is also possible to use non-square size of filter (see Inception Network), but it is just more difficult to handle...that's it.  Afterall, there is no real evidence that square-filters do not work, thus most of networks prefer square-sized filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How should we convolve the edges?**. Should we do the entire image?  Should we maintain the output features to be the same size as input features?  Recall this image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/no_padding_no_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It has 4 x 4 pixels = 16 features.  But after convolution, we only got 2 x 2 pixels = 4 features left.  Is that good?  There is no correct answers here but we are quite sure that we lose some information.  In fact, it is always nice to **maintain the output features to be the same size as input features**, but how?  There is no space to convolve since the filter is 2 x 2 and it can only shift right one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **padding**, where we can enlarge the input image by padding the surroundings with zeros.  How much?  Padding until we get the original size or larger size, for example, like this.  The below put zero padding around which result the output features to be the same size as input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/same_padding_no_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The below put even more padding which pad to make sure each single pixel is convoluted (full padding), which result the output features to be even large\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/full_padding_no_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it is easiest to understand padding from the 1D input like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ input_{padded} = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, large size may benefit from more features, but also suffer from lengthy training time.  It is probably best to only perform enough padding to get the same size as input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Strides\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How many step we should take to slide our filter? Skip 2?** Should we shift 1 step per convolution, or 2 steps, or how many steps.  **In fact, it really depends on how detail you want it to be.  But defining bigger steps reduce the feature size and thus reduce the computation time.**  Bigger step is like human scanning picture more roughly but can reduce the computation time....whether to use it is something to be experimented though. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision, we called this step as **stride**.  Example is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**No padding with stride of 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/no_padding_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding with stride of 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/padding_strides.gif\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual image convolution can look like this (with stride 1 and no padding):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/conv.gif\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The convoluted image may look like this (nothing relate with the above matrix though):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/convimages.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**The formula to be used to measure the padding value to get the spatial size of the input and output volume to be the same with stride 1** is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{K-1}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the filter size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if our image is size $24 * 24$, and the filter size is $3 x 3$, then our $K$ has size 3 so the padding should be $(3-1)/2 = 1$, then we need to add **a border of one pixel valued 0 around the outside of the image**, which would result in the input image of size $26 * 26$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What would be the shape of the output matrix? Also in summary, what is the shape of the input, output, and filter?**.  Recall that in Dense layer, the shape of weight matrix is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "<code>(neuron_{in}, neuron_{out})</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a image of 24 x 24 pixels = 576 features.  Let's say we got around 1000 images, thus our input has a shape of (1000, 576).  Thus the input layer should have 576 neurons.  Let's say our next hidden layer has 10 neurons, what should be the shape of the weight matrix?  The answer is easy, we need to simply find the ? here:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 576) @ ? = (1000, 10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the weight matrix would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (576, 10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where you can clearly see 576 is the number of input neurons and 10 is the number of output neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our question is **how about convolutional layers**.  In convolutional layer, the shape of input has shape of <code>(batch size, input channels, image height, image width)</code>.  For example, let's say after we have 1000 of batch size, 3 input channels, and image height and width to be 24, thus the shape of input is <code>(1000, 3, 24, 24)</code>.  Now let's say we would like output channel of 4?  What should be the shape of the weight matrix?  Also, what would be the shape of the output?  The answer is a little tough, but we know one thing is that the number of samples will remain the same, thus we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 3, 24, 24) \\circledast W = (1000, 4, O, O) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "O actually depend on W, i.e., on the stride (denote as $S$), padding (denote as $P$), filter size (denote as $F$) as well as the input width and height (denote as $I$). $O$ can be calculated with the formula as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O = \\frac{I-F+2P}{S} + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an input image of size $3*24*24$, we apply filters of size $3*3$, with single stride and no zero padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I=24, F=3, P=0 and S=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the output volume will be $([24-3+0]/1)+1 = 22$.  Thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1000, 3, 24, 24) \\circledast (3, 4, 3, 3)_{p=0, s=1} = (1000, 4, 22, 22) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, \n",
    "\n",
    "- The input will have a 4D shape of <code>(batch size, input channels, input height, input width)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output will have a 4D shape of <code>(batch size, output channels, output height, output width)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolutional filters will have 4D shape of <code>(input channels, output channels, filter height, filter width)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The order does not matter and it depends on the python library you use but these four dimensions always exist in CNN.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general rule of selecting padding, stride and filter size are of course of trial-and-error.  But it's important to remember that they should result in output image size of integers not decimals\"\n",

    "### 2. Max/Average Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about **reducing computation time**, a common way is to perform a **pooling layer** which simply downsample the image by average a set of pixels, or by taking the maximum value.  If we define a pooling size of 2, this involves mapping each 2 x 2 pixels to one output, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"../../figures/pooling.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, pooling has a really big downsides, i.e., it basically lose a lot of information.  Compared to strides, strides simply scan less but maintain the same resolution but pooling simply reduce the resolution of the images....As Geoffrey Hinton said on Reddit AMA in 2014 - **The pooling operation used in CNN is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster**.  In fact, in most recent CNN architectures like ResNets, it uses pooling very minimially or not at all.  In this lecture, we are not going to implement pooling, but we just talk about it for the sake of completeness since very early architectures like AlexNet uses pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Flatten Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be said that in CNN, probably there are many convolutional layers.  However, in the last layer, typically, if we want to predict a certain class, it make sense to use Dense layer as the output layer.  However, the question is how do we send input of shape $(\\text{size}, \\text{image height}, \\text{image width}, \\text{input channels})$ into Dense layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually quite easy.  What we can do is simply squash all these 4D vectors into 2D vectors.  For example, given (1000, 2, 22, 22), through a *flatten* operation, the vector becomes (1000, 968), which we can then multiply with weight just like in Dense layer, make predictions, and calculate loss just like we did in previous class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we can perform *flatten* operation?  Does it not lost any information?  This is because through flattening, it is just another representations, thus flattening does not result in any loss of information.  It also allow the Dense layer to understand the relationships of visual patterns from prior convolutional layers to the output."

As those of you who are familiar with computational complexity will realize, this code is catastrophically slow: to calculate the parameter gradient, we needed to write seven nested for loops! There’s nothing wrong with doing this, since the purpose of writing the convolution operation from scratch was to solidify our understanding of how CNNs work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll show how to express the batch, multichannel convoution operation in terms of a batch matrix multiplication to implement it efficiently in NumPy.   To understand how the convolution works, consider what happens in the forward pass of a fully connected neural network:\n",

    "We receive an input of size <code>[batch_size, in_features]</code>.\n",
    "We multiply it by a parameter of size <code>[in_features, out_features]</code>.\n",

    "We get a resulting output of size <code>[batch_size, out_channels, img_height, img_width]</code>.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key to making the convolution operation look more like a regular feed-forward operation is to first extract img_height × img_width “image patches” from each channel of the input image. Once these patches are extracted, the input can be reshaped so that the convolution operation can be expressed as a batch matrix multiplication using NumPy’s <code>np.matmul</code> function.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Get image patches of size <code>[img_height x img_width, batch_size, in_channels, filter_size, filter_size]</code>\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Reshape parameter to be <code>[in_channels × filter_size × filter_size, out_channels]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After we do a batch matrix multiplication, the result will be <code>[batch_size, img_height × img_width, out_channels]</code>\n",

    "5. Reshape this to be <code>[batch_size, out_channels, img_height, img_width]</code>\n",
